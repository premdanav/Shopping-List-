Shopping List App
This is a simple shopping list application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, edit, and remove items from your shopping list, as well as filter the items based on your input.

Features
Add Items: You can add new items to your shopping list by entering them in the input field and clicking the "Add Item" button.

Edit Items: If you need to modify an item, you can click on the item text to enter edit mode. After making your changes, click the "Update Item" button to save your edits.

Remove Items: You can remove items from your list by clicking the "X" button next to each item.

Filter Items: There's a filter input field that allows you to search for specific items in your list.

Clear All: If you want to clear your entire shopping list, there's a "Clear All" button that will remove all items.

Local Storage: The app utilizes local storage to store your items, so they persist even if you close the browser.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Enter item names and optionally select their priority levels (not explicitly mentioned in the README but based on your code).

Click the "Add Item" button to add items to your list.

To edit an item, click on the item's text and make your changes. Then, click the "Update Item" button.

To remove an item, click the "X" button next to it.

Use the filter input field to search for specific items in your list.

Click the "Clear All" button to clear your entire shopping list.

How It Works
The app uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It also stores your items in the browser's local storage.
